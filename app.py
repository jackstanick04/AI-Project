## IMPORT STATEMENTS

# import flask object and request method (req method allows to store data that is imported)
from flask import Flask, request
# import os allows for python to talk to my personal mac (like where files are stored), but this is entirely optional for the project
import os
# import for gemini api
from google import genai
# import types (makes container for the image to be passed through (packages it)
from google.genai import types

## API, FLASK, AND FILE STORING DECLARATIONS

# set up gemini client (my connection to the gemini api)
gem_client = genai.Client(api_key = "CONSTANT")
# set up for flask object, name part is just telling flask object its location on the computer?
fl = Flask(__name__)
# creating a folder to store the images in; caps indicate the variable is a constant
FOLDER_NAME = "image_uploads"
# check if the folder exists, and if not, make it (need .path, but logically if it doesn't exist then a path wouldn't exist either)
if not os.path.exists(FOLDER_NAME) : 
    os.makedirs(FOLDER_NAME)

## MAIN PROGRAM DECLARATION

# decorator 
# route checks the url, if it ends in image (can be any word) and a post request, then call decorator
@fl.route("/image", methods = ["POST"])
# python function we want to be called when decorator works (main program)
def process_image() :

    # INPUT CHECKING FOR IMAGE UPLOAD

    # checking the right "form" of upload is an image
    # request.files holds all the files uploaded as a dictionary, with the type as the key and the acutal file as the value (make sure its an image box and not a video box)
    if "image" not in request.files : 
        return "did not upload correct file type"
    # check to make sure something was actually uploaded, even if the category of image was right (make sure image box isnt empty)
    # get the value of the stored files at image key, then get its name and ensure its not empty (empty would mean nothing uploaded)
    img = request.files["image"]
    if img.filename == "" : 
        return "did not actually upload an image"
    
    ## LOADING THE IMAGE, MOVING IT TO THIS MAC, AND PROCESSING THE IMAGE INTO PART OBJECT

    # read the img file as binary bits
    img_binary = img.read()
    # use os import to store the file path from our destination to the image we recieved
    # actually store the image (not its name) to my computer using this filepath
    path = os.path.join(FOLDER_NAME, img.filename)
    request.files["image"].save(path)

    # package the binary image data to be sent using types
    # sends the mime type (image here) and the actual image binary to be used
    proc_image = types.Part.from_bytes(
        data = img_binary,
        # file content type always gives the right type of image
        mime_type = img.content_type
    )

    ## INSTANCIATING MODEL AND GETTING TEXT RESPONSE

    # call the model we want with the prompt we want and the image data
    # it takes a list of "arguments" (the model type and then contents--prompts are the processed image and prompt)
    # prompt engineering and system instructions above are big area for improvement!!!!!!
    full_resp = gem_client.models.generate_content(
        model = "gemini-3-flash-preview",
        contents = [
            "Please describe what you see in this image.",
            proc_image
        ]
    )
    # response includes multiple things, we just want to store the text
    gem_text = full_resp.text

    ## OUTPUT FOR CLARIFICATION

    # printing confirmation to python console
    print(gem_text)
    # returning message to go to apple terminal
    return "success. image uploaded and parsed."

## MAIN METHOD

# name is a variable assigned to the file and how it is being used
# if i run a python file, its name is main; if i import it, its name is the file name, not main
# thus, this main method only gets ran (server only set up) when running this file, not importing it
if __name__ == "__main__" : 
    # start server, and restart the server every time I refresh
    fl.run(debug = True)
